    "text": "Hello and welcome to my webpage! My name is Jenevieve and this is my first time attempting to create a data story.\nI am a Year 1 Communications and New Media major with a minor in Interactive Media Development. This webpage serves as a platform for me to share my journey, insights and project with you.\nThank you for visiting!💟\n\nWhat emotions are evoked in the Harry Potter series, and how do they evolve over time?\nfor NM2207.\n\n  \n  Our first look at Harry.\n\nThis all started with a particularly interesting question. \nPicture this: It’s a rainy afternoon and you’re diving back into the magical world of Harry Potter, when suddenly, a curious question strikes you like a bolt of lightning⚡ - what if we could quantify the emotional impact of each chapter, dissecting the highs and lows with the precision of a potion master?\nAs I embarked on my journey through the pages of J.K. Rowling’s beloved series once more, this question lingered in the back of my mind like a persistent spell. Could the joy, the sorrow, the excitement, and the fear evoked by these timeless tales be quantified and analysed?\nTo do this, I retrieved a proprocessed dataset which contained all Harry Potter books in txt file format, and ran them through an emotion sentiment analyser , a powerful tool promising to unveil the hidden emotional nuances nestled within the text. \n\nThe difference between how readers interpret a passage's emotion sentiment and how an emotion sentiment analyser interprets the passage lies in the subjective nature of human emotions and the objective algorithms used by sentiment analysis tools.\n\nReaders’ Interpretation: Readers’ interpretation of emotion sentiment is subjective and influenced by individual experiences, perspectives, and cultural backgrounds. They may perceive emotions differently based on personal context, preferences, and emotional sensitivity.\nEmotion Sentiment Analyzer’s Interpretation: Emotion sentiment analysis relies on objective algorithms to analyse text and quantify emotional content. These algorithms are trained on large datasets and use predefined rules or machine learning models to identify and categorise emotional cues in text.\n\nBefore we get into the results of the data analysis, let’s play a game to see how you would identify and categorise emotional cues in text.\nHere are several excerpts from the actual Harry Potter books. For each one, select which emotion you think is the most prevalent. Don’t think too hard about it—just react!\ndue to problems encountered with the game, it has not been included in the website yet.\nAs you read the Harry Potter excerpts, you likely gravitated towards specific emotions, reflecting your individual perspective and emotional awareness. This subjective interpretation is a hallmark of human cognition, shaped by our individual experiences, biases, and cultural backgrounds.\nIn contrast, emotion sentiment analysers rely on objective algorithms to analyze text and measure emotional content. While these algorithms provide insights and efficiency in processing large volumes of data, they lack the nuanced understanding and context of human emotion interpretation.\nNow, let’s see how the emotion sentiment analyser interprets the Harry Potter series using the data gathered.\n\n\n  \n  Platform nine and three-quarters.\n\n  \n ⚡️⚯ 🧹 \n\nSentimentr Package \nThe sentimentr package by Tyler Rinker in R is designed to accurately calculate text polarity sentiment at both the sentence and token levels. It offers enhanced precision in sentiment scoring by considering valence shifters like negators, amplifiers, de-amplifiers, and adversative conjunctions.\n  \n 🏰🔮✨ \nTwo Sentiments: Positive and Negative \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\nBy plotting at the sentiment score for each chapter of each book, we can clearly mark events in the books. \nThe three greatest spikes in that chart above are \nCedric Diggory’s death at about chapter 88, \nSirius Black's death at about chapter 129, and \nDumbledore’s death at about chapter 159.\n  \n 🦁🐍🦅🦡\nEight Basic Emotions: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise, Trust, and Anticipation"
