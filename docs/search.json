    "text": "Hello and welcome to my webpage! My name is Jenevieve and this is my first time attempting to create a data story.\nI am a Year 1 Communications and New Media major with a minor in Interactive Media Development. This webpage serves as a platform for me to share my journey, insights and project with you.\nThank you for visiting!💟\n\nHow do emotions evolve throughout the Harry Potter series, including the development of individual characters’ emotional arcs?\nfor NM2207.\n\n  \n  Our first look at Harry.\n\nThis all started with a particularly interesting question. \nPicture this: It’s a rainy afternoon and you’re diving back into the magical world of Harry Potter, when suddenly, a curious question strikes you like a bolt of lightning⚡ - what if we could quantify the emotional impact of each chapter, dissecting the highs and lows with the precision of a potion master?\nTo do this, I retrieved a proprocessed dataset which contained all Harry Potter books in txt file format, and ran them through an emotion sentiment analyser , a powerful tool promising to unveil the hidden emotional nuances nestled within the text. \n\nThe difference between how readers interpret a passage's emotion sentiment and how an emotion sentiment analyser interprets the passage lies in the subjective nature of human emotions and the objective algorithms used by sentiment analysis tools.\n\nReaders’ Interpretation: Readers’ interpretation of emotion sentiment is subjective and influenced by individual experiences, perspectives, and cultural backgrounds. They may perceive emotions differently based on personal context, preferences, and emotional sensitivity.\nEmotion Sentiment Analyzer’s Interpretation: Emotion sentiment analysis relies on objective algorithms to analyse text and quantify emotional content. These algorithms are trained on large datasets and use predefined rules or machine learning models to identify and categorise emotional cues in text.\n\nNow, let’s see how the emotion sentiment analyser interprets the Harry Potter series using the data gathered.\n\n\n  \n  Platform nine and three-quarters.\n\n  \n ⚡️⚯ 🧹 \n\nSentimentr Package \nThe sentimentr package by Tyler Rinker in R is designed to accurately calculate text polarity sentiment at both the sentence and token levels. It offers enhanced precision in sentiment scoring by considering valence shifters like negators, amplifiers, de-amplifiers, and adversative conjunctions.\n  \n  📜🏰⌛ \n\n\nExploring Emotional Sentiment Trends\nTwo Sentiments: Positive and Negative \n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\nBy plotting at the sentiment score for each chapter of each book, we can clearly mark events in the books. \nThe three greatest spikes in that chart above are \nCedric Diggory’s death at about chapter 88, \nSirius Black's death at about chapter 129, and \nDumbledore’s death at about chapter 159.\n  \n 🦁🐍🦅🦡\nEight Basic Emotions: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise, Trust, and Anticipation \n\n\n     \n\n\n\n     \n\n 👻🧙📖 \nEmotional Spectrum: Insights in Pie\n\nDistribution of Emotions in the Harry Potter Series\n\n  \n\nThe piechart helps to identify which emotions are most prevalent across the series. This could indicate the overall mood or tone of the narrative.\n\nSadness emerges as the dominant emotion, comprising 21% of the emotional spectrum. Several factors can contribute to the prevalence of sadness in the series:\n\n  Deeply rooted themes of loss and sacrifice.\n  Significant personal tragedies experienced by characters.\n  Profound sadness and grief evoked by the deaths of beloved characters like Harry's parents, Sirius Black, and Dumbledore.\n\n\n 🧊️🦌🌲\nHaving identified sadness to be the most prominent emotion in the series, I sought to explore its potential correlations with other emotions in the narrative.\nAfter obtaining an overall understanding of the emotional sentiment trends, I shifted my focus to explore deeper connections among the different emotions portrayed throughout the series.\n\n\nInvestigating Emotional Correlations\n\n\n  \n  \"After all this time?\" \"Always,\" said Snape.\n\nWe begin by creating a correlation heat map. This visual provides insights into the correlation between different emotional states.\n\nInsights from Correlation Heat map \n\n\n    \n        Emotion Correlation Heat map\n        \n        \n        Here's an overview of the correlations between emotions as revealed by the heat map.\n        Emotions with the strongest positive correlations are:\n        \n        Anger and sadness at 0.87.\n        Disgust and fear at 0.7.\n        Sadness and fear at 0.61.\n        \n    \n    \n        Sadness-centric Line Chart Analysis\n        \n        \n        Sadness exhibits the strongest positive correlation with anger (0.87).\n        \n        \n        \n        Sadness demonstrates its most notable (albeit weak) negative correlation with joy at -0.14.\n        \n    \n\nThe animated line charts juxtapose the emotional trajectories of sadness with anger and joy, highlighting their respective positive and negative correlations as depicted in the correlation heatmap.\n\nThe strong positive correlation between sadness and anger (0.87) can be attributed to the complex emotional journeys of characters like Harry Potter and Severus Snape. These characters often experience intersecting emotions in response to various events:\n  \n  Harry grapples with the loss of loved ones, personal struggles, and betrayals, which elicit a blend of sorrow and indignation. \n  Similarly, Severus Snape's tragic past, conflicted loyalties and redemption arc contribute to his multifaceted emotional landscape, characterised by a mixture of sadness and bitterness.\n  \n The weak negative correlation between sadness and joy (-0.14) in Harry Potter may seem counterintuitive at first glance, but it can be elucidated through the complexities of character experiences:\n  \n  While sadness pervades many instances in the series, there are also moments of joy and camaraderie amidst the turmoil. \n  For example, Harry and his friends find solace and moments of levity in their friendships, achievements, and triumphs against adversity.\n  \n\n\n 🎩🗡🐍\nDue to the preprocessing steps* applied to the book data, there was difficulty in accurately discerning character emotions based on dialogue. To counter this, I acquired an alternative dataset containing dialogue from the movie series.\n\n*particularly the removal of symbols, including speech open and inverted commas\n\n\nDetermining Character Importance\n\n\n  \n  \"Not me, not Hermione, YOU.\"\n\nQuantifying dialogue distribution across characters offers a straightforward method to discerning their importance within the story.\n Key Findings from Character Dialogue Distribution Analysis\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n        \n    \n\n\nAs expected, Harry naturally assumes 1st place as the protagonist. The animated bar chart showcasing character dialogue by movie clearly highlights Harry's prominence, with his dialogues dominating each installment of the series.\n\nHowever, what's striking is the significant disparity in dialogue lines between Harry and his best friend, Ron. While it is typical for the main character to take center stage, the fact that Harry's dialogue surpasses Ron's by more than double highlights the narrative's clear focus on Harry, solidifying his pivotal role to the series.\n\n Another fascinating detail is Voldemort's placement as the 9th character with the most dialgues in the series. Despite his relative lower dialogue count, his impact on the narrative is undeniable.\n\n As the main antagonist, Voldemort embodies fear, respect, and evil, instilling terror in both characters and readers alike. His character’s presence is so potent that it transcends the need for extensive dialogue. Instead, his mere existence evokes a sense of foreboding and menace, demonstrating the power of a well-conceived and executed character."
