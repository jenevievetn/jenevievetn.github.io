    "text": "Hi there! I‚Äôm Jenevieve, the curator of this cozy little nook in the digital universe.\nI fancy myself a bit of a storyteller, adept at spinning yarns with words and visuals alike. But here‚Äôs the twist: I‚Äôm now wading waist-deep into the vast sea of data for the first time. So, brace yourself for this maiden voyage into the realm of numbers and statistics. Will we navigate these uncharted waters successfully? I sure hope so!\n\nWhat emotions do key events in the Harry Potter series evoke, and how do they evolve over the course of events?\nfor NM2207.\n\n  \n  Our first look at Harry.\n\nThis all started with a particularly interesting question. \nPicture this: It‚Äôs a rainy afternoon and you‚Äôre diving back into the magical world of Harry Potter, when suddenly, a curious question strikes you like a bolt of lightning‚ö° - what if we could quantify the emotional impact of each chapter, dissecting the highs and lows with the precision of a potion master?\nAs I embarked on my journey through the pages of J.K. Rowling‚Äôs beloved series once more, this question lingered in the back of my mind like a persistent spell. Could the joy, the sorrow, the excitement, and the fear evoked by these timeless tales be quantified and analysed?\nTo do this, I retrieved a proprocessed dataset which contained all Harry Potter books in txt file format, and ran them through an emotion sentiment analyser , a powerful tool promising to unveil the hidden emotional nuances nestled within the text. \n\nThe difference between how readers interpret a passage's emotion sentiment and how an emotion sentiment analyser interprets the passage lies in the subjective nature of human emotions and the objective algorithms used by sentiment analysis tools.\n\nReaders‚Äô Interpretation: Readers‚Äô interpretation of emotion sentiment is subjective and influenced by individual experiences, perspectives, and cultural backgrounds. They may perceive emotions differently based on personal context, preferences, and emotional sensitivity.\nEmotion Sentiment Analyzer‚Äôs Interpretation: Emotion sentiment analysis relies on objective algorithms to analyse text and quantify emotional content. These algorithms are trained on large datasets and use predefined rules or machine learning models to identify and categorise emotional cues in text.\n\nBefore we get into the results of the data analysis, let‚Äôs play a game to see how you would identify and categorise emotional cues in text.\nHere are several excerpts from the actual Harry Potter books. For each one, select which emotion you think is the most prevalent. Don‚Äôt think too hard about it‚Äîjust react!\ndue to problems encountered with the game, it has not been included in the website yet.\nAs you read the Harry Potter excerpts, you likely gravitated towards specific emotions, reflecting your individual perspective and emotional awareness. This subjective interpretation is a hallmark of human cognition, shaped by our individual experiences, biases, and cultural backgrounds.\nIn contrast, emotion sentiment analysers rely on objective algorithms to analyze text and measure emotional content. While these algorithms provide insights and efficiency in processing large volumes of data, they lack the nuanced understanding and context of human emotion interpretation.\nNow, let‚Äôs see how the emotion sentiment analyser interprets the Harry Potter series using the data gathered.\n\n\n  \n  Platform nine and three-quarters.\n\n  \n ‚ö°Ô∏è‚öØ üßπ \n\nSentimentr Package \nThe sentimentr package by Tyler Rinker in R is designed to accurately calculate text polarity sentiment at both the sentence and token levels. It offers enhanced precision in sentiment scoring by considering valence shifters like negators, amplifiers, de-amplifiers, and adversative conjunctions.\n  \n üè∞üîÆ‚ú® \nTwo Sentiments: Positive and Negative \n\n\n\n  \n  Positive and negative sentiments throughout the series.\n\nBy plotting at the sentiment score for each chapter of each book, we can clearly mark events in the books. The three greatest spikes in that chart above are Cedric Diggory‚Äôs death at about chapter 88, Sirius Black‚Äôs death at about chapter 129, and Dumbledore‚Äôs death at about chapter 160.\n  \n ü¶Åüêçü¶Öü¶°\nEight Basic Emotions: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise, Trust, and Anticipation \n\n\n\n  \n  Anger sentiments throughout the series.\n\n\n\n  \n  Anticipation sentiments throughout the series.\n\n\n\n  \n  Disgust sentiments throughout the series.\n\n\n\n  \n  Fear sentiments throughout the series.\n\n\n\n  \n  Joy sentiments throughout the series.\n\n\n\n  \n  Sadness sentiments throughout the series.\n\n\n\n  \n  Surprise sentiments throughout the series.\n\n\n\n  \n  Trust sentiments throughout the series."
