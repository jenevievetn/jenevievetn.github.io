    "text": "Hello and welcome to my webpage! I‚Äôm Jenevieve, Year 1 Communications and New Media major with a minor in Interactive Media Development.\nThank you for visiting!üíü\n\nHow do emotions evolve throughout the Harry Potter series, including the development of individual characters‚Äô emotional arcs?\nfor NM2207.\n\n  \n  Our first look at Harry.\n\nThis all started with a particularly interesting question. \nPicture this: It‚Äôs a rainy afternoon and you‚Äôre diving back into the magical world of Harry Potter, when suddenly, a curious question strikes you like a bolt of lightning‚ö° - what if we could quantify the emotional impact of each chapter, dissecting the highs and lows with the precision of a potion master?\nTo do this, I retrieved a preprocessed dataset which contained all Harry Potter books in txt file format, and ran them through an emotion sentiment analyser , a powerful tool promising to unveil the hidden emotional nuances nestled within the text. \n\nThe difference between how readers interpret a passage's emotion sentiment and how an emotion sentiment analyser interprets the passage lies in the subjective nature of human emotions and the objective algorithms used by sentiment analysis tools.\n\nReaders‚Äô Interpretation: Readers‚Äô interpretation of emotion sentiment is subjective and influenced by individual experiences, perspectives, and cultural backgrounds. They may perceive emotions differently based on personal context, preferences, and emotional sensitivity.\nEmotion Sentiment Analyzer‚Äôs Interpretation: Emotion sentiment analysis relies on objective algorithms to analyse text and quantify emotional content. These algorithms are trained on large datasets and use predefined rules or machine learning models to identify and categorise emotional cues in text.\n\nNow, let‚Äôs see how the emotion sentiment analyser interprets the Harry Potter series using the data gathered.\n\n\n  \n  Platform nine and three-quarters.\n\n  \n ‚ö°Ô∏è‚öØ üßπ \n\nsentimentr Package \nThe sentimentr package by Tyler Rinker in R is designed to accurately calculate text polarity sentiment at both the sentence and token levels. It offers enhanced precision in sentiment scoring by considering valence shifters like negators, amplifiers, de-amplifiers, and adversative conjunctions.\n  \n  üìúüè∞‚åõ \n\n\nExploring Emotional Sentiment Trends\nTwo Sentiments: Positive and Negative \n\nSentiment scores typically indicate the presence and intensity of certain emotions.\n\nPositive sentiment scores represent positive emotions like joy, trust, and anticipation.\nNegative sentiment scores represent negative emotions like anger, fear, and sadness.\n\n\nThese scores provide insights into the emotional tone or mood conveyed in a text, helping to gauge the overall sentiment expressed in the narrative.\n\n\n\n    \n    Interactive tooltip indicates the corresponding chapter number, sentiment score and book title.\n\n\n\nBy plotting the sentiment score for each chapter of each book, we can clearly mark events in the books. \nThe three greatest spikes in that chart above are \nCedric Diggory‚Äôs death at about chapter 88, \nSirius Black's death at about chapter 129, and \nDumbledore‚Äôs death at about chapter 159.\n  \n ü¶Åüêçü¶Öü¶°\nEight Basic Emotions: Anger, Disgust, Fear, Joy, Sadness, Surprise, Trust, and Anticipation \n\nDisplayed below are line charts illustrating the fluctuation of the emotions throughout the series.\n\n\n     \n    How to read the graph: Hover your cursor along any point on the graph to view more information on the intensity of emotion experienced in each book. Toggle between the Sentiment Analysis Tab and the Chapter Summary Tab to seamlessly switch between detailed emotional insights and concise storyline overviews.\n\n\n\nThis chart generates for the different emotions one at a time on separate plots, limiting the ability to discern relationships and patterns between different emotional states.\n\nHence, I included the below chart which allows users to select and compare multiple emotional sentiments on the same plot. This enhancement provides a more comprehensive view of the emotional landscape within the storyline.\n\n\n     \n\n üëªüßôüìñ \nEmotional Spectrum: Insights in Pie\nMoving on from the temporal tracking of emotions, we'll now delve into their distribution within the storyline.\n\nDistribution of Emotions in the Harry Potter Series\n\n  \n\nThe piechart helps to identify which emotions are most prevalent across the series. This could indicate the overall mood or tone of the narrative.\n\nSadness emerges as the dominant emotion, comprising 21% of the emotional spectrum. Several factors can contribute to the prevalence of sadness in the series:\n\n  Deeply rooted themes of loss and sacrifice.\n  Significant personal tragedies experienced by characters.\n  Profound sadness and grief evoked by the deaths of beloved characters like Harry's parents, Sirius Black, and Dumbledore.\n\n\n üßäÔ∏èü¶åüå≤\nHaving identified sadness to be the most prominent emotion in the series, I sought to explore its potential correlations with other emotions in the narrative.\n\nAfter grasping the overall emotional trends, I shifted my focus to explore the deeper connections among emotions, particularly focusing on sadness.\n\n\nInvestigating Emotional Correlations\n\n\n  \n  \"After all this time?\" \"Always,\" said Snape.\n\nWe begin by creating a correlation heat map. This visual provides insights into the correlation between different emotional states.\n\nInsights from Correlation Heat map \n\n\n    \n        Emotion Correlation Heat map\n        \n        \n        Here's an overview of the correlations between emotions as revealed by the heat map.\n        Emotions with the strongest positive correlations are:\n        \n        Anger and sadness at 0.87.\n        Disgust and fear at 0.7.\n        Sadness and fear at 0.61.\n        \n    \n    \n        Sadness-centric Line Chart Analysis\n        \n        \n        Sadness exhibits the strongest positive correlation with anger (0.87).\n        \n        \n        \n        Sadness demonstrates its most notable (albeit weak) negative correlation with joy at -0.14.\n        \n    \n\nThe animated line charts juxtapose the emotional trajectories of sadness with anger and joy, highlighting their respective positive and negative correlations as depicted in the correlation heatmap.\n\nThe strong positive correlation between sadness and anger (0.87) can be attributed to the complex emotional journeys of characters like Harry Potter and Severus Snape. These characters often experience intersecting emotions in response to various events:\n  \n  Harry grapples with the loss of loved ones, personal struggles, and betrayals, which elicit a blend of sorrow and indignation. \n  Similarly, Severus Snape's tragic past, conflicted loyalties and redemption arc contribute to his multifaceted emotional landscape, characterised by a mixture of sadness and bitterness.\n  \n The weak negative correlation between sadness and joy (-0.14) in Harry Potter may seem counterintuitive at first glance.\n  \n  While it is expected for sadness to be negatively correlated with joy, the weak correlation is surprising in the context of Harry Potter. \n  It suggests that while there are instances of both sadness and joy in the series, they do not consistently influence each other to a significant degree.\n  \nThis nuanced understanding underscores the complexity of human emotions within the fictional world of Harry Potter.\n\n\n üé©üó°üêç\nDue to the preprocessing steps* applied to the book data, there was difficulty in accurately discerning character emotions based on dialogue. To counter this, I acquired an alternative dataset containing dialogue from the movie series.\n\n*particularly the removal of symbols, including quotation marks\n\n\nDetermining Character Importance\n\n\n  \n  \"Not me, not Hermione, YOU.\"\n\nQuantifying dialogue distribution across characters offers a straightforward method to discerning their importance within the story.\nI chose to focus exclusively on the top 10 characters with the most extensive dialogue distributions.\n Key Findings from Character Dialogue Distribution Analysis\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n        \n    \n\nTop 10 important characters in the series based on their dialogue distributions.\n\n\nHarry naturally assumes 1st place as the protagonist.\n\nHarry's dialogues dominate each installment in the series as shown by the animated bar chart for character dialogue by movie, emphasising his prominence in the series.\n\n\nHowever, what's striking is the significant disparity in dialogue lines between Harry and his best friend, Ron.\n\nHarry's dialogue surpasses Ron's by more than double.\n\nThis highlights the narrative's clear focus on Harry, solidifying his pivotal role to the series.\n\n\n Another fascinating detail is Voldemort being only 9th place  despite his role as the main antagonist. Despite his relatively lower dialogue count, his impact on the narrative is undeniable.\n\nVoldemort embodies fear, respect, and evil, instilling terror in both characters and readers alike. His character‚Äôs presence is so potent that it transcends the need for extensive dialogue.\nHis mere existence evokes a sense of foreboding and menace, demonstrating the power of a well-conceived and executed character.\n\nNow that we have established the top 10 pivotal characters in the series, let's take a look at their emotional trajectories.\n\nCan we determine the similarities and variations in characters' experiences based on their emotions?\n\n üöÇüß±üõíüèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è\n\n\nUncovering Unique Emotional Profiles\n\n  \n  All was well.\n\nComparison of character‚Äôs average emotion sentiment scores to identify the characters who exhibit the strongest emotional tendencies across the series.\n\n     \n\n The data reveals intriguing insights into the emotional dynamics of the central characters.\n\nHarry emerges with the highest average scores for anticipation, joy, surprise and trust\nRon exhibits the highest levels of anger, disgust, fear and sadness.\n\n\nHarry's role as a beacon of hope, resilience, and optimism is contrasted by Ron's surprising depth of emotion and vulnerability that may not be immediately apparent.\n\nThis revelation prompts further exploration into Ron's character development, shedding light on the challenges and struggles he faces alongside his friends. \n\n\n\nConclusion\nEmotional Distribution\n\nPrevalence of sadness as a dominant emotion in the series, offers insight into the characters' internal struggles and challenges they face on their journey.\nExploration of connections between different emotions (such as anger and sadness) provide a deeper understanding of characters' emotional experiences and the complex interplay between different emotional states.\n\n\nCharacter Importance and Emotional Tendencies\n\nBrings to light the pivotal roles of key characters like Harry and Ron.\nComparative analysis of characters' average emotion sentiment scores reveal Harry's positive emotional tendencies and Ron's depth of negative emotions, unveiling a layer of vulnerability and emotional complexity.\n\n\nThe End\n\n  \n  Illustrated by @nocomic on instagram."
