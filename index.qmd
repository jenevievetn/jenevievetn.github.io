Hi there! I'm Jenevieve, the curator of this cozy little nook in the digital universe.

I fancy myself a bit of a storyteller, adept at spinning yarns with words and visuals alike. But here's the twist: I'm now wading waist-deep into the vast sea of data for the first time. So, brace yourself for this maiden voyage into the realm of numbers and statistics. Will we navigate these uncharted waters successfully? I sure hope so!

# What emotions do key events in the Harry Potter series evoke, and how do they evolve throughout the series?

Here, you'll find a mishmash of my digital doodles, tech tinkering, and musings about life, the universe, and everything in between.
