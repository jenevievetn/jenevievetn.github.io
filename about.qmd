Hello and welcome to my webpage! My name is **Jenevieve** and this is my first time attempting to create a data story.

I am a Year 1 *Communications and New Media* major with a minor in Interactive Media Development. This webpage serves as a platform for me to share my journey, insights and project with you.

Thank you for visiting!ðŸ’Ÿ

## How I made this

To conduct this analysis, I utilised a [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moxxis/harry-potter-lstm?select=Harry_Potter_all_books_preprocessed.txt) comprising all seven Harry Potter books in TXT format, which had been preprocessed by Mateusz Kudla and made available on Kaggle.

Additional preprocessing was performed using the tidytext and textdata packages in R. Each book's text was segmented into chapters, allowing for a more granular analysis. The chapter-wise text was then compiled into a tibble, facilitating streamlined data handling and analysis.
