## How I made this

To conduct this analysis, I utilised a [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moxxis/harry-potter-lstm?select=Harry_Potter_all_books_preprocessed.txt) comprising all seven Harry Potter books in TXT format, which had been preprocessed by Mateusz Kudla and made available on Kaggle.

Additional preprocessing was performed using the tidytext and textdata packages in R. Each book's text was segmented into chapters, allowing for a more granular analysis. The chapter-wise text was then compiled into a tibble, facilitating streamlined data handling and analysis.
